The Banking Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to efficiently handle various banking operations including creating new accounts, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and updating holders' personal data. This system streamlines the process of managing banking activities, ensuring accuracy, security, and ease of use for both bank staff and customers.

Creating New Account:
The system provides a user-friendly interface for bank staff to easily create new accounts for customers. Upon initiating the process, the staff member enters necessary details such as customer information, account type, initial deposit amount, and any additional preferences. The system then generates a unique account ID and securely stores all pertinent information in the database.

Deposit:
Customers can deposit funds into their accounts through various channels, including over-the-counter transactions or digital banking platforms. When a deposit is made, the system verifies the account details and updates the account balance accordingly. It ensures real-time updating of account balances to reflect the deposited amount accurately.

Withdraw:
Similarly, customers can withdraw funds from their accounts through authorized channels such as ATMs, online banking, or visiting the bank branch. The system validates the withdrawal request against the available balance in the customer's account and processes the transaction securely. It ensures adherence to withdrawal limits and verifies customer identity to prevent unauthorized access.

Update Holders' Personal Data:
Customers may need to update their personal information due to changes in circumstances such as change of address, contact number, or other personal details. The system provides a straightforward mechanism for customers to submit requests for updating their information. Bank staff can then review and authenticate the requests before updating the data in the system. This ensures that the customer database remains accurate and up-to-date, facilitating effective communication and service delivery.
